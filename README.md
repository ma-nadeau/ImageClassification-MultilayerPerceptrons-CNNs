# ImageClassification-MultilayerPerceptrons-CNNs


## Overview

The complexity of modern medical imaging datasets has driven the need for advanced machine learning models capable of achieving accurate and efficient classification. This repository explores the OrganAMNIST dataset, a challenging benchmark derived from medical imagery, to evaluate the effectiveness of different neural network architectures for organ classification.

We investigate and compare the performance of:

Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs): Foundational models in machine learning, which struggle with capturing spatial dependencies in image data.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for spatial feature extraction, leveraging convolutional layers to create hierarchical representations.
Pre-trained MobileNetV2: A lightweight architecture that transfers knowledge from large-scale datasets, achieving high accuracy with reduced training time.
This project emphasizes the importance of hyperparameter optimization (e.g., learning rate, batch size, and regularization strength) and explores the trade-offs between computational efficiency and performance.
